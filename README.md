This project stemmed from my CSE385 Final Project. For this class, I had to use a database, either downloaded or created on my own, and make a GUI that allows a user to view the data.
I knew that I wanted to use Premier Legaue data, but I could not find any good datasets, so I decided to create my own.

This is an optimized version of the web scraper I wrote for that final project, but instead of adding the data directly to the database, it adds the data to a CSV file that can be
downloaded. I did it this way so that anyone looking for a good Premier League dataset for a project can simply download the CSV files and import them into a databse.

This web scraper takes data from fbref.com and creates different CSV files for each team, each season, the season stats for each team in each season, and every match played in each 
season. The data is taken from season 1992/1993 until the present season.
